# elm-pointer

`elm-pointer` is an HTML pointer API package, that tries to unify some of the event
fields and events accross mouse and touch interactions. For example, you can describe
a drag event with a mouse or by touch similarly - they both have a start point and a 
current point and an end event.

This package is not about low-level interaction with pointers, but attempts to
provide a more user focussed and high level abstraction on the HTML pointer API, that is focussed on using it.
